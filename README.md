# Ajax

This is the repo for [Udacity's Ajax course](). The course covers making asynchronous requests using three different methods:

[* the XHR object](https://salah-yousef.github.io/search-app/lesson-1-async-w-xhr/)
[* jQuery's `.ajax()` method](https://salah-yousef.github.io/search-app/lesson-2-async-w-jQuery/)
[* the Fetch API](https://salah-yousef.github.io/search-app/lesson-3-async-w-fetch/)

The same project is built with each of these techniques. You'll find one folder for each.
